    <h2>Current Research</h2>
    <p>
        I am currently pursuing a PhD at the University of Technology Sydney, focusing on SLAM and 3D reconstruction in deformable gastrointestinal environments.
        My research addresses the challenges of soft-tissue motion, low-texture appearance, and lighting variation in endoscopic navigation. I develop deformation-aware SLAM frameworks that combine photometric optimization, learning-based feature extraction, and active exploration strategies, enabling accurate mapping and localization in dynamic, real-world medical settings.
