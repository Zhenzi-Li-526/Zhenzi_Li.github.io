    <h2>Current Research</h2>
    <p>
        I am currently pursuing my PhD degree in Robotics Institute, University of Technology Sydney, Australia. My PhD supervisor is Prof. Huang Shoudong.
        My current research interests are SLAM, medical surgical robots, and optimization problem. 
        I received my B.S. and M.S. from Wuhan University, China in 2018 and 2021. I worked as a research assistant at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, China from 2023 to 2024.
